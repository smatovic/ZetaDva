### Binaries ###
Linux 64 bit and Windows 32/64 bit binaries are placed in bin folder, 
they were build with the gcc resp. mingw compiler.
Linux binary was tested with Xboard and Cutechess.
Windows 64 bit binary was tested on Windows 7 64 bit with Arena and Winboard.
Had no chance to test the Windows 32 bit executeable.

### Play ### 
To play against the engine use an CECP v2 protocol capable chess GUI
like Arena, Cutechess, Winboard or Xboard.

Alternatively you can use Xboard commmands directly on commmand Line,
e.g.:
new            // init new game from start position
level 40 4 0   // set time control to 40 moves in 4 minutes
go             // let engine play site to move
usermove d7d5  // let engine apply usermove in coordinate algebraic
               // notation and optionally start thinking

Not supported Xboard commands:
analyze        // enter analyze mode
?              // move now
draw           // handle draw offers
hard/easy      // turn on/off pondering
hint           // give user a hint move
bk             // book Lines

Non-Xboard commands:
perft          // perform a performance test, depth set by sd command
selftest       // run an internal test
help           // print usage info
log            // turn log on

### Compile from Source ###

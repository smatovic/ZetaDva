### Binaries ###
Linux 64 bit and Windows 32/64 bit binaries are placed in bin folder, 
they were build with the gcc and mingw compiler.

### Play ### 
To play against the engine use an CECP v2 protocol capable chess GUI
like Arena, Winboard or Xboard.

Alternatively you can use Xboard commmands directly on commmand Line,
e.g.:
new            // init new game from start position
level 40 4 0   // set time control to 40 moves in 4 minutes
go             // let engine play site to move
usermove d7d5  // let engine apply usermove in coordinate algebraic
               // notation and optionally start thinking

Non-Xboard commands:
perft          // perform a performance test, depth set by sd command
selftest       // run an internal test
help           // print usage info
log            // turn log on

Not supported Xboard commands:
analyze        // enter analyze mode
undo/remove    // take back last moves
?              // move now
draw           // handle draw offers
hard/easy      // turn on/off pondering
hint           // give user a hint move
bk             // book Lines
pause/resume   // pause/resume the engine


### Opening Book ###
The delivered opening book is by Dann Corbit and is placed in the doc folder.
Zeta supports Polyglot .bin books, just name the file "book.bin" and put it in
the same directory like the engine.

### Compile from source ###
The source code and a GNU/Linux Makefile are placed in src folder.

### Binaries ###
Linux 64 bit and Windows 32/64 bit binaries are placed in bin folder. 
For Linux gcc, and for Windows mingw, did the job.

### Play ### 
You need an Chess GUI with CECP v2 support like Xboard,Winboard or Arena for play.
Alternatively you can use xboard commands directly on command line.

### Opening Book ###
The delivered opening book lies in the doc folder and is by Dann Corbit.
Zeta supports Polyglot .bin books, just name the file "book.bin" and put it in
the same directory like the engine.

### Compile from Source ###
The source code and a Makefile are placed in src folder.

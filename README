### Binaries ###
Linux 64 bit and Windows 32/64 bit binaries are placed in bin folder. 
For Linux gcc, and for Windows mingw, did the job.

### Play ### 
To play against the engine use an UCI protocol capable chess GUI like
Arena, Winboard or Xboard with Polyglot adapter

Alternatively you can use UCI commmands directly on commmand line, e.g.
...

### Opening Book ###
The delivered opening book lies in the doc folder and is by Dann Corbit.
Zeta supports Polyglot .bin books, just name the file "book.bin" and put it in
the same directory like the engine.

### Compile from source ###
The source code and a Makefile are placed in src folder.
